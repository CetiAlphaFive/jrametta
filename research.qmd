**The Lingering Effects of the Contract with America on Congressional Capacity**

My dissertation focuses on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity, as well as inter-branch politics. To this end, I compile two novel datasets encompassing the universe of public reports from the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office. With these datasets, I am able to derive high resolution images of the effects of the Contract with America on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity across a wide range of substantive domains and federal agencies. These data also provide a venue to test longstanding theories of inter-branch and legislative-bureaucratic relations.
