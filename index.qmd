Hello there!

I'm a PhD candidate in [Political Science](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) with subfields in methods and American politics.

I employ causally oriented machine learning methods to study American political institutions and public policy. My dissertation research focuses on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity, as well as inter-branch politics.

I'm also interested in the development and application of new methods, as well as accompanying software tools, for difficult social science problems. I have several projects in-progress in this vein with co-authors.

Before graduate school, I was an economic policy research analyst at the [Bipartisan Policy Center](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/). At BPC, I contributed to research on the [federal budget](https://www.pgpf.org/sites/default/files/PGPF-2019-Solutions-Initiative.pdf), [debt limit](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Debt-Limit-Analysis-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-March-2019.pdf), [Social Security and Medicare financing](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-Guide-to-the-2018-Social-Security-and-Medicare-Trustees-Reports.pdf), and [defense personnel reform](https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2018-09/2019_IndexOfUSMilitaryStrength_CHAPTERS_MISZTAL-RAMETTA.pdf).
