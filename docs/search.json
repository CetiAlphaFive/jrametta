My dissertation research focuses on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity, as well as inter-branch politics.\nI’m also interested in the development and application of new methods, as well as accompanying software tools, for difficult social science problems. I have several projects in-progress in this vein with co-authors.\nBefore graduate school, I was an economic policy research analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center. At BPC, I contributed to research on the federal budget, debt limit, Social Security and Medicare financing, and defense personnel reform."

    "text": "Dissertation Project\nThe Lingering Effects of the Contract with America on Congressional Capacity\nMy dissertation focuses on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity, as well as inter-branch politics. To this end, I compile two novel datasets encompassing the universe of public reports from the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office. With these datasets, I am able to derive high resolution images of the effects of the Contract with America on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity across a wide range of substantive domains and federal agencies. These data also provide a venue to test longstanding theories of inter-branch and legislative-bureaucratic relations.\nMethods Projects\nThe Balance Permutation Test: A Machine Learning Replacement for Balance Tables (with Sam Fuller)\nUnder Review.\nMachine Learning for Subgroup Analysis: Powerful and Dangerous (with Sam Fuller)\nWorking Paper, 2023. A version of this project was presented at MPSA 2023.\nOmnibus, Cross-Validated Variable Importance Scores (with Sam Fuller)\nWorking Paper, 2022.\nSubstantive Projects\nAffect or Ideology?: The Heterogeneous Effects of Political Cues on Policy Support (with Nicolás de la Cerda and Sam Fuller)\nUnder Review.
