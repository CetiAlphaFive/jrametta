    "text": "Hello there!\nI’m a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Davis with subfields in methods and American politics.\nI employ causally oriented machine learning methods to study American political institutions and public policy. My dissertation research focuses on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity, as well as inter-branch politics.\nI’m also interested in the development and application of new methods, as well as accompanying software tools, for difficult social science problems. I have several projects in-progress in this vein with co-authors.\nBefore graduate school, I was an economic policy research analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center. At BPC, I contributed to research on the federal budget, debt limit, Social Security and Medicare financing, and defense personnel reform."

    "text": "Dissertation Project\nThe Lingering Effects of the Contract with America on Congressional Capacity\nMy dissertation focuses on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity, as well as inter-branch politics. To this end, I compile two novel datasets encompassing the universe of public reports from the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office. With these datasets, I am able to derive high resolution images of the effects of the Contract with America on Congressional oversight and policymaking capacity across a wide range of substantive domains and federal agencies. These data also provide a venue to test longstanding theories of inter-branch and legislative-bureaucratic relations.\nMethods Projects\nThe Balance Permutation Test: A Machine Learning Replacement for Balance Tables (with Sam Fuller)\nUnder Review.\nMachine Learning for Subgroup Analysis: Powerful and Dangerous (with Sam Fuller)\nWorking Paper, 2023.
